# gdebug
Shitty disassembler written in Python.
To use, enter a filename in the top text box and click either "Load Executable" or "Export ASM", Load Executable opens it in the window, Export ASM writes the ASM of the file to a .asm file (duh.) If you modify in the editor window and then click export, it will save your changes.
